I've been hired and invited to developer interview processes. 

Some companies prioritize technical skills most, while others look for cultural-fit candidates. 

You can often tell by how they prioritize their cultural interviews and what they ask.

Here, I'll share some common interview questions. 
I won't discuss how to answer them, as you can use AI to generate the best responses. 
However, by asking and answering these questions, both the candidate and hiring manager can learn more about each other.

## Questions
### Personal

    * Can you describe the environment where you do your best work?
    * What does work-life balance mean to you?
    * What are you passionate about?
    * Do you have any role models? Why do they inspire you?

### Feedback

    * What format do you prefer for receiving feedback?
    * How would you address feedback if someone was underperforming, such as a junior developer?

### Workplace

    * Describe a time you had to deliver a project under a very tight deadline.
    * Have you ever disagreed with your team on a solution to a problem? If so, how did you resolve it?
    * Give me an example of a tough conversation you've had at work.
    * Describe a situation where you believe you didn't handle the situation well and could have done better.

### Growth/Development

    * How do you learn new technologies?
    * What do you envision yourself doing in five years?
    * Is there a specific role or career path you aspire to in the future?

### Others

    * Why did you choose to apply to this company?
    * What excites you about the company, industry, or opportunity?
    * What is your impression of our company's culture?
    * What does a positive company culture look like to you?

## What to Expect

Don't expect to find model answers for these questions. 
The questions themselves shouldn't have predefined responses. 
Instead, focus on the follow-up questions that interviewers might ask to learn more about your values and approach to work.

For example, if asked about a time you had to deliver a project under a tight deadline, 
the interviewer might follow up with "How did you find that experience?" or "Is there a better way you think you could have approached the situation?" 

These follow-up questions allow the interviewer to understand your priorities and problem-solving skills.

## Look for Red Flags ðŸš©

Cultural interviews are an excellent opportunity to identify red flags, or signals that a candidate might be a potential harm to the team culture.

While it's okay to have different preferences (like preferring basketball over football), we want to look for red flags such as:

* Poor communication skills
* Tendency to hide problems
* Lack of teamwork
* Ignoring suggestions
* Blaming others

Of course, the specific red flags to watch for will depend on your team's culture.

## Ask Questions Too

Don't treat the interview as a one-way conversation. 
It's a communication process. 
You deserve to know more about the company, team, and people you might potentially work with.
Don't hesitate to ask questions during the "Do you have any questions?" session.

By observing the format, attitude, and questions asked, you can gain insights into the team's culture.

## Conclusion

Interviewing can be challenging for both sides. 
It's about understanding each other within a limited amount of time.
Questions and answers are tools to exchange ideas and values, helping you find your future working partners. 

Good luck to those looking for jobs or candidates.
