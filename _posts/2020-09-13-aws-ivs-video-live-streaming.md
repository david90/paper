WIP.

I am keen to find out more about AWS IVS.

## What is AWS IVS?
Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS) is a managed live streaming solution.
It's easy to stream nowadays via Youtube, Facebook, Instagram to your audience. How about on your own platform? Amazon IVS helps developers to build a system to stream low-latency live video to viewers around the world easily.
