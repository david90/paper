Hello world!

This is not my first blog.


I've been writing on several platforms since the Xanga era.

Then Facebook Notes, [Logdown](https://david.logdown.com), [Medium](https://medium.com/@iamdavidng). Finally I decided to migrate to my own site.

> [Web site is still important](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19784907).


This domain has been online for a while, but I've been too lazy to put up all things together. Some contents are scattered around, so it's a great chance to pull

them back together.



Thanks for reading.
