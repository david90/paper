Hi there. I'm David Ng, currently living in Hong Kong. I've been crafting software for web, iOS and Android for years.

I used to be a Software Engineer at [Oursky](https://oursky.com), and a growth engineer at [SCMP]("https://www.scmp.com").
Recently, I've joined the Technology Innovation Team in a leading group to bring digital changes to the organization.

I write program and [blog](https://medium.com/@iamdavidng) about software development and digital technologies, such as machine learning, NLP and software engineering.
