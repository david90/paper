Hi. Thanks for visiting!
I'm David from Hong Kong. I've been developing web, iOS and Android apps for years.

I used to be a Growth engineer at [SCMP]("https://www.scmp.com"). Currently I've moved on to gain more time for my personal projects.

I write program and [blog](https://medium.com/@iamdavidng) about software development and digital products when I have time.
